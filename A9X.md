# [A9X] The South — Codex Edition

## Overview

The South is a region of dramatic contrast, split between the Imperial-controlled savannas and the independently governed Golden Sea. It is home to both powerful trade cities and nomadic tribes, ancient arcane traditions and imperial exploitation. The region’s complex relationship with the Arcane Covenant gives rise to overlapping sovereignties, semi-formal magical enforcement, and deep ideological divisions.

## 1. Regional Structure

### The Southern Imperial Protectorate
- Fertile savanna zone bordering the Golden Sea.
- Population: Estimated 1–2 million.
- Operates as an **Imperial Protectorate**, administered by:
  - Imperial nobles (Dukes, Grand Dukes, Counts)
  - Trade guilds backed by feudal charters
- Functionally a **resource-extractive frontier**, akin to colonial outposts.
- Main exports:
  - Arcane reagents
  - Agricultural products
  - Rare minerals
- Cultural conflict exists between:
  - Feudal trade interests (Imperial nobles)
  - Concordian merchant envoys
  - Indigenous inhabitants and tribal allies

### The Golden Sea (Desert Core)
- Vast desert zone home to the **Twelve Tribes**:
  - **6 Settled Tribes** based in Oasis Cities
  - **6 Nomadic Tribes** with caravan sovereignty
- Not formally part of the Protectorate or the Empire.
- Political governance handled by the **Council of Twelve Tribes**:
  - Deliberative and decentralized
  - Major decisions require consensus or majority alignment
- Region includes:
  - Ancient ruins and arcane anomalies
  - Sacred sites and memory shrines
  - Caravans that serve as both commerce and cultural lifelines

## 2. Emberdeep Academy

- Hidden within the Golden Sea.
- One of the Seven Grand Academies.
- Known for:
  - Harsh magical trials
  - Endurance rites and survival-focused curriculum
  - Emphasis on lost or forgotten arcana
- Operates independently of the Twelve Tribes, though many students come from nomadic lineages.
- Faculty scouts often embed within caravans to observe potential initiates without disclosure.
- Home to the **Emberdeep Society of Forgotten Arcane Knowledge**.

## 3. Pax Arcana — Canonical Definition

**Pax Arcana** is the term used to describe a region’s formalized relationship with global arcane governance:

1. Representation in the **Arcane Conclave**
2. Ceding of magical legal jurisdiction to the **Arcane Court**
3. Adherence to the terms of the **Arcane Covenant**

#### Application in The South:
- **Southern Imperial Protectorate**:
  - Fully observes Pax Arcana
  - Magical law functions identically to within the Empire
- **Golden Sea Tribes**:
  - Mixed alignment
  - All have agreed to permit **Arcane Court pursuit** of rogue Mages
  - Not all tribes fully accept Arcane Court sovereignty or Conclave representation
  - The Conclave is **actively negotiating** for full tribal inclusion

---

## 4. Arcane Enforcement

- Arcane Court presence in the Golden Sea is minimal and often delegated:
  - Desert Arbiter circuits
  - Conclave-aligned nomadic sheriffs
- Enforcement is strongest around:
  - Oasis cities
  - Major caravans
  - Emberdeep’s vicinity
