# [A5X] The Concordian Cities — Codex Edition

## Summary
The Concordian Cities, also known as the **Twin Rivers Concord**, represent a powerful eastern republican bloc built along two mighty rivers. The alliance comprises three politically distinct but tightly interlinked city-states: **Cindral**, **Parithal**, and **Vassreth**. Though each city maintains its own governance system, they operate under a shared national identity and legislative body: the **Concordian Senate**.
