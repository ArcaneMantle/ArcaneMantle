# [A99X] Reserved and Staging Topics — Codex Edition

## Purpose

This codex serves as a placeholder and scaffolding registry for major arcane or worldbuilding topics that are:

- Not yet canonized
- Currently under revision
- Thematically significant but structurally incomplete

Entries here are *deliberately provisional* and serve to ensure these areas remain visible during future expansion phases.
