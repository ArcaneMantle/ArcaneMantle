# [A12X] The Arcane Conclave — Codex Edition

## Overview

The Arcane Conclave (AC) is the primary global body responsible for arcane diplomacy, magical policy legislation, and the philosophical governance of magic. It was established through the **Arcane Covenant**, a treaty among sovereign states that defines the rights and responsibilities of Mages and magical institutions within civil society.

The Conclave exists not to control Mages, but to protect the world from magical overreach—and to protect Mages from political exploitation.

## 3. The Select Council *(Requires Mandatory Revision)*

> This section is placeholder-only and must be updated following a scrape of prior logs.

- The current composition reflects a post-pruning default and **does not represent canon**.
- Until revised, the Select Council will be treated as consisting of:
  - 2 Academy-aligned representatives

This structure is **NOT canonical** and exists only to support gameplay defaults until properly restored.
