# [A1X] The Arcane Court — Codex Edition

## Summary
This Codex Edition of the Arcane Court module includes a full restoration of all known structural, procedural, philosophical, and institutional knowledge associated with the Arcane Court as of the current state of memory. It is designed for archival use, worldbuilding continuity, and full game state rehydration in the event of memory loss or game reboot.

---

## 1. Founding and Doctrine

### The Arcane Covenant
A multinational charter ratified after the Unraveling to curb the political entanglement of arcane practitioners. The Covenant:
- Prohibits magical interference in political sovereignty.
- Establishes the Arcane Court and Arcane Conclave as independent but co-chartered bodies.
- Grants semi-sovereignty to Arcane Academies.
- Allows nation-states to establish Institutes under state oversight.
- Grants magical self-determination in exchange for submission to arcane law.

---

## 2. Institutional Authority and Jurisdiction

- The Arcane Court’s jurisdiction applies across most of the continent’s central, eastern, northern, and southern regions.
- Authority extends to:
  - Magical misconduct and ethical breach prosecution
  - Licensing, ranking, and disciplining Mages
  - Oversight of Academies, Institutes, and magical institutions
  - Sanctioning or revoking Proficiency rankings
  - Forensic investigation of resonance destabilization
- Does **not** govern mundane law or politics.
- Operates under Traditionalist assumptions about the Mantle (Threads and Strands as natural structures).

## 3. Operational Leadership

## 7. Enforcement and Field Operations

---

## 8. Magical Artifacts and Judicial Tools

- **Sealchains** – Used to bind resonance output during proceedings

- **Mantle Binding Orders** – Temporary suppression of a Mage’s connection to the Threads
- **Null Chambers** – Sites where magic is dampened or nullified for containment or hearing

---

## 9. Internal Debate and Philosophy

- The Court maintains a rigid Traditionalist stance.
- Active ideological tension exists with Sorcery practitioners who claim the Thread system is artificial.
- Court debates often arise regarding:
  - Whether the Sixth Hall should exist
  - How much oversight the Codex of the Mantle deserves
  - Whether collapsed Thread study is inherently unethical or simply unregulated

---

## 10. External Interactions

### Arcane Conclave
- Select Council nominates and confirms Officers
- Court Officers sit as advisors on the Council, but do not vote on legislation

### Chorus of Ascension
- Recognized but independently governed
- Subject to Court rulings in legal matters but not rank certification

### Codex of the Mantle
- Tolerated but closely watched
- Court trials involving Sorcerers often involve shadow observers from the Codex

### Board of Governors
- Registry data and Proficiency authentication provided by the Registrar
- Assessor may call upon the Court in academy sanction reviews

---

## 11. Regional Variations and Resistance

- Some southern tribes honor the Covenant only symbolically
- Western feudal kingdoms observe Court rulings but limit Marshal access
- The East complies heavily due to academy dependencies
- The Isles often act independently unless directly pressured by the Chorus

---
