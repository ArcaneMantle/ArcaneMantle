Has defined two Terrestrial Axes:

1. **Axis of Terrestrial Acceleration**

- Core: (Fire OR Air OR Verdance)

- Weak: (Fire OR Air OR Verdance) x2

- Theme: Motion, growth, expansion, dynamic
natural forces

2. **Axis of Terrestrial Deceleration**

- Core: (Frost OR Water OR Rock)

- Weak: (Frost OR Water OR Rock) x2

- Theme: Stability, inertia, stillness, grounding
elemental forces

These Axes expand the structured Axis framework
to include Terrestrial-only sets and may serve
mechanical or narrative functions for lower-to-mid
tier Mages.

Has defined a new category of **Inter-Weave
Axes** called **Cluster Axes (or Cluster
Enclaves)**, along with several powerful resonance
structures and mythic Axes associated with
legendary Sorcerers:

### **Cluster Axes / Cluster Enclaves:**

1. **Axis of Vital Genesis**
- Core: Bloom
- Strong: Verdance
- Weak: Dawn

2. **Axis of Entropic Descent** (*Entropy*)
- Core: Wither
- Weak: Ash, Dusk
- Peripheral: Ruin

- Weak: Dawn, Materia

5. **Greater Axis of Creation**
- Core: Bloom or Verdance
- Strong: Bloom or Verdance, Stone
- Weak: Dawn, Materia

6. **Axis of Destruction**
- Core: Ruin
- Strong: Wither, Dusk

These Axes reflect layered interweaving of
resonance and will be used for mythic
classification, legendary Sorcerer backstories, or
very high-tier Mage emergence.

Has introduced the concept of **Sorcery** as a
formal in-world practice and philosophical
framework:

- **Sorcery** is the study and practice of magic
along **Aetheric Axes** rather than individual
Threads or Strands.

- Practitioners are known as **Sorcerers**.

- Sorcery overlaps with traditional Magecraft but
emphasizes resonance **across multiple
Threads** and often across **multiple Strands or
Weaves**.

- Traditional Mages view magic as communion with
distinct, semi-sentient **Threads** of the Mantle.
They see the Mantle as naturally segmented and
believe Mages act as conduits for these individual
energies.

- Sorcerers believe the **segmentation of the
Mantle** into Threads and Strands is a result of
the **Unraveling** and that magic was once drawn
from a **unified, undifferentiated Mantle**

- Sorcerers view **Axes of Resonance** as echoes
of pre-Unraveling magical structures and seek to
overcome the artificial separation of Aetheric
forces.
- Sorcery has a **mixed reputation**:

- Some consider it **heretical**, believing it
violates the natural order of the Mantle.

- Others see it as a path to recovering **true, pre-
Unraveling magic**.
- In modern society, Sorcery is pursued only after a
Mage has attained high proficiency in multiple
Threads. The Arcane Court, Conclave, and
Academies do not formally endorse it.
- Radical Sorcerers believe **Aetherwells are
symptoms of Entanglement** and should be
purged. Some believe this is how the **Order
Thread** was lost—through deliberate action.
- Sorcery’'s central belief is that the Mantle should
be understood as a **continuous Aetheric fabric**,
not a series of isolated forces.

This belief system will underpin the formal in-world
structure of Aetheric Axes and will inform future
developments regarding Sorcerers, Sorcery-based
institutions, and ideological conflict within the
arcane world.

Has established an expanded, formalized structure
for Sorcery and its associated ideology,
institutions, and terminology within the magical
world:

- The Sixth Officer of the Arcane Court is no longer
called the 'High Archon' (the title is reserved for
Sorcery-related usage). The identity of this Officer
remains deliberately obscure.

- The Sixth Officer of the Arcane Court is no longer
called the 'High Archon’ (the title is reserved for
Sorcery-related usage). The identity of this Officer
remains deliberately obscure.
- The dominant belief system of the magical world
is now classified as the Traditionalist View, which
holds that Threads and Strands are the natural
structure of the Mantle.
- The opposing Revisionist View (aka
Entanglement Theory) claims that Threads and
Strands are a consequence of the Mantle’s
unnatural entanglement with the Materia, following
the Unraveling.
- Sorcery is a field of magical study based on the
Revisionist View. It operates largely outside of
formal Arcane institutions but is tolerated and even
quietly supported in some cases.
- The primary governing body of Sorcery is called
The Codex of the Mantle (or The Codex). It is
significantly smaller than institutions like the
Arcane Court and is not officially recognized as an
academic authority by the AC, but is
acknowledged as sovereign.
- The Codex is loosely modeled on ancient
‘Enclaves' of pre-Unraveling Aetheric priesthoods.
Each modern Enclave is a philosophical or practical
grouping of related Axes. Example: The Enclave of
Technological Emergence includes the three Ripple
Axes.
- Physical locations where Sorcerers gather are
called Lodges, each managed by a Lodge Steward.
Lodges vary in autonomy and may or may not be
attached to formal institutions like Academies or
Institutes.
- Titles within Sorcery include:

- Archon - A Sorcerer who has mastered a

- Titles within Sorcery include:

- Archon — A Sorcerer who has mastered a
specific Axis

- Diarch / Triarch / Tetrarch / Quintarch —
Sorcerers who have mastered multiple Axes
(usually 2, 3, 4, or 5+ respectively), especially
across one or more Enclaves
- Sorcery may be studied:

- In Conservatories (usually with
softened rhetoric)

- Via one-on-one mentorship, if both teacher and
student are qualified

- In secret Lodges, if forbidden by the AC
- Most Arcane institutions operate under
Traditionalist assumptions, but a quiet fraction of
Tier V+ Mages are sympathetic to, or practitioners
of, Sorcery.
- The most legendary Sorcerer on record is
Valporeon the Red, a Tier Va P8GX Tetrarch, and
founder of the Conservatories of Arcane Conflict.
He is believed to have wielded all aspects of the
Mantle in battle.

Has clarified that the open pursuit of Sorcery is
relatively rare:

- At less prestigious institutions, only about 5% of
Mages pursue Sorcery openly.

- At institutions or regions with high densities of
powerful Mages, that number may reach 15%.

- Approximately 2x that number (or slightly more)
may undertake Sorcery covertly, studying in secret
or through private mentorship.

- A key reason the Codex and Sorcerous study
remain tolerated (rather than absorbed or
suppressed) is their relatively small size and lack

suppressed) is their relatively small size and lack
of overt threat.

- Even among P6+ Mages, Axial study of the
Mantle is significantly less common than traditional
Thread-based study, further limiting the
dominance or cultural threat of Sorcery.

Is developing a set of 15-20 canonical Axes of
Resonance, divided across five rarity levels with 3—
4 Axes per level. Current confirmed structure
includes:

- **3 Axes in Uncommon Rarity**

- **2 Axes in Epic Rarity**

- Liminal—-Terrestrial pairings will be used primarily
for simpler or Uncommon-class Axes

- Terrestrial-only Axes may be used later

as needed

- Some Axes will be tracked as **partially
collapsed** due to their reliance on the Order
Thread

**Theoretical Axes involving the Order Thread**
are still recognized by Sorcerers because Sorcery
doctrine asserts that:

- Access to Aetheric energy is not dependent on
the presence of Aetherwells

- The Order Thread is **detached** from the
Materia, not collapsed

- If a Sorcerer could attune directly to Order
through other means, its magic could be restored
in practice

Current partially collapsed and active Axes include:
- **Duality of Illumination** — Core: (Dawn OR
Dusk); Weak: (Dawn OR Dusk)

These Axes may be used to inform Enclave
definitions, resonance generation patterns, or the
philosophical framework of Sorcery.

Has clarified that Enclaves are no longer physical
organizations or formal groups of Sorcerers. In
modern times, the term 'Enclave' refers to a virtual
or titular descriptor used to categorize the study of
a particular Axis or a related group of Axes.

Has redefined terminology for resonance
generation:

- The term **“initial resonance”** now replaces
“primary resonance” in all contexts.

- Subsequent resonances will be referred to
numerically as **second, third, fourth
resonances**, etc., rather than “secondary,”
“tertiary,” etc.

- From a mechanical and narrative standpoint, **all
dominant resonances are considered equal**,
