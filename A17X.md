# [A17X] The Chorus of Ascension — Codex Edition

## Overview

The **Chorus of Ascension**, often simply called **The Chorus**, is the most revered council of Archmages across the continent. Though not legislative or judicial, it represents the peak of recognized magical wisdom, spiritual authority, and doctrinal influence within arcane society.

When the Court interprets, and the Conclave legislates, the Chorus **consecrates**.
