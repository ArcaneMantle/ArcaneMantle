# [A14X] Mage Character Creation and Resonance Framework — Codex Edition

## Overview

This codex defines the structure, logic, and gameplay framework for creating Mages within the Mantle world system. It establishes resonance tiering, Thread assignment, Axis construction, Discord penalties, and institutional affiliations such as Academies, Guilds, or Orders.

---

## 1. Resonance Tier Structure

Each Mage is categorized by **Tier**, representing both their raw potential and formal training:

- **Tier I** – Untrained latent Mage or low-tier initiates
- **Tier II** – Academy novice, basic Thread training (up to 2 resonances)
- **Tier III** – Journeyman-level Mage (up to 3–4 resonances)
- **Tier IV** – High Mage or specialist (5+ resonances, often Axis-based)
- **Tier V** – Legendary Archmage or Axis Master (fully harmonized or divergent)

---

## 2. Resonance Selection Process

### Core Process (Tier II+)
1. **Initial Resonance**: Primary Aetheric affinity. Can be Terrestrial, Liminal, or Confluent (Tier III may include Celestial).
2. **Second Resonance**: Influenced by the initial; may expand to complementary category.
3. **Third Resonance**: Assigned only at Tier III. Defaults to Terrestrial unless forced by Axis or component logic.
4. **Component Fulfillment**: Confluent Threads require at least one of their Terrestrial component Threads.

### Dominant vs. Recessive
- **Dominant Resonance**: Actively shapes magic, stronger spellcasting affinity
- **Recessive Resonance**: Passive influence, secondary capabilities

---

## 3. Discord Penalties

Penalties apply to Mages who have conflicting or unstable resonance combinations.

### Terrestrial
- Two Dominant Threads in same Strand (e.g., Fire + Frost): **+0.5**

### Liminal
- Two Dominant Threads in same Strand (e.g., Dawn + Dusk): **+1.0**
- One Dominant + One Recessive: **+0.5**

### Confluent
- Opposed Emergent + Reflex (e.g., Forge + Ash): **+1.0**
- Dominant + Recessive: **+0.5**
- Emergent + Opposed Reflex (e.g., Steam + Bog): **+0.5**

### Celestial
- Each Strand:  
  **(Total Resonances - 1) × (Dominant Resonances + 1)**

---

## 4. Axis-Based Character Creation

Some Mages, especially Sorcerers, structure their resonance using **Aetheric Axes**.

### Axis Structure:
- **Core** – Always Dominant
- **Strong** – 2/3 chance Dominant
- **Weak** – 1/3 chance Dominant
- **Peripheral** – Always Recessive

### Par Calculation (Resonance Load Benchmark)
- Core: 2.0
- Strong: 1.67
- Weak: 1.33
- Peripheral: 1.0

These values inform mechanical load and balance during gameplay.

---

## 5. Proficiency Bands

Mages may be marked with metal bands signifying rank:

- **Apprentices**: 1–2 thin bands
- **Journeymen**: 1–4 regular bands
  - Adjuncts: Notched or unadorned bands
  - 3rd–1st Class: Embellishments or engravings
- **1st Class with Distinction**: Rare symbols or sigils
- **Archmages**: Glyph-enhanced, enchanted metallic tokens

Bands are authenticated by **Registrars of Magical Proficiency**.

---

## 6. Institutional Affiliation

Character generation may include allegiance or certification from:

- **Grand Academies** (formal education and high-tier sponsorship)
- **Chartered Guilds** (professional skill or specialty magic)
- **Orders** (philosophical or martial alignment)
- **Independent Lodges or Sorcerous Conservatories** (Sorcerers only)

## Appendix: Mage Character Generation Algorithm

This step-by-step algorithm defines the mechanical procedure for generating a Mage's resonance profile and related attributes.

---

### STEP 1 — Select Tier

| Tier | Max Resonances | Special Rules |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Tier I | 1 | Latent or untrained |
| Tier II | 2 | No Celestial Threads allowed |
| Tier III | 3 | Third resonance must be Terrestrial unless forced |
| Tier IV | 4+ | Axis integration encouraged |
| Tier V | Variable | Custom load allowed; typically Axis-based |

---

### STEP 2 — Roll Initial Resonance

- Roll from weighted category pool (Terrestrial, Liminal, Confluent, Celestial*)
- *Celestial only permitted at Tier III+

---

### STEP 3 — Roll Second Resonance

- Roll is weighted based on Initial category:
  - Terrestrial → increased chance of another Terrestrial or Liminal
  - Confluent → must check for required components
  - If Confluent, add **minimal** Terrestrial Threads to satisfy component logic

---

### STEP 4 — Assign Third Resonance (Tier III+ only)

- Always defaults to **Terrestrial** unless:
  - Required to fulfill Confluent component
  - Required to match Axis structure
- May not duplicate existing resonance unless duplication is part of Axis load

---

### STEP 5 — Axis Mode (Optional)

If Axis-based creation is selected:

- Identify a matching Axis using first and second resonance
- Assign Core/Strong/Weak/Peripheral roles
- Roll Dominance as follows:
  - Core = 100% Dominant
  - Strong = 2/3 Dominant
  - Weak = 1/3 Dominant
  - Peripheral = Always Recessive

---

### STEP 6 — Determine Dominance (Non-Axis Mode)

If not Axis-based:
- For each resonance:
  - Roll 1d3:
    - 1–2 = Dominant
    - 3 = Recessive
  - Duplicate Threads must always be Recessive unless overridden

---

### STEP 7 — Check for Component Fulfillment (Confluent Threads)

- Each Confluent Thread must be supported by **at least one** of its Terrestrial components
- Do not add more than one unless required to fulfill multiple Confluents with shared anchor

---

### STEP 8 — Calculate Discord Penalties

Apply penalties based on Thread combinations:

- **Terrestrial**: 2 Dominants in same Strand = +0.5
- **Liminal**:
  - 2 Dominants in same Strand = +1.0
  - 1 Dominant + 1 Recessive = +0.5
- **Confluent**:
  - Dominant Emergent + Dominant Reflex = +1.0
  - Dominant + Recessive = +0.5
  - Emergent + Reflex (cross-paired) = +0.5
- **Celestial**:
  - (Total Resonances - 1) × (Dominant + 1)

---

### STEP 9 — Calculate Par Load

If Axis is used, calculate Resonance Load using:

- Core = 2.0
- Strong = 1.67
- Weak = 1.33
- Peripheral = 1.0

Compare to Mage's Tier-based load capacity or use as balancing benchmark.

This algorithm can be used in solo or collaborative character creation and supports both Traditionalist and Sorcerous builds.
