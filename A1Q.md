## A1Q.01 — Court Creation and Political Boundaries

- **Prompt:**  
  > “What’s the relationship between the Arcane Court, the Empire, and the Concord of Crowns?”

- **User Answer:**  
  > The Arcane Court is not part of the Empire. It was created by the Arcane Covenant, a supra-national agreement. Most states in the central, near north, near west, near south, and eastern coast honor this covenant. The Court is independent and oversees magical law only.

- **Parsed Note:**  
  The Arcane Court was established by the Arcane Covenant and operates independently of the Empire. It has jurisdiction across the majority of civilized territories, focusing exclusively on magical law. It does not regulate mundane law or national governance. “Concord of Crowns” is a deprecated or alternate term for the Empire. The “Concordian Cities” are a separate republican federation in the East.

## A1Q.02 — Court vs. Conclave Relationship

- **Prompt:**  
  > “Is the Arcane Court subordinate to or part of the Arcane Conclave?”

- **User Answer:**  
  > No. The Court is independent like a Supreme Court. The Select Council of the Conclave nominates its Officers, and they advise the Council, but once confirmed, the Court operates independently. The Court and Conclave are co-chartered under the Arcane Covenant.

- **Parsed Note:**  
  The Arcane Court is co-equal to the Conclave under the Arcane Covenant. Officers are confirmed by the Conclave’s Select Council and sit as advisors, but the Court is judicially independent. This mirrors the U.S. system of judicial appointment and separation of powers.

## A1Q.03 — Operational Leadership Structure

- **Prompt:**  
  > “Is there a broader leadership structure beneath the five Principal Officers?”

- **User Answer:**  
  > No. The five Officers form the full operational leadership. However, the Marshal of the Court is often involved in high-level discussions, even though they are not a voting member.

- **Parsed Note:**  
  There is no expanded governing body within the Court beyond the five Principal Officers. The Marshal of the Court, while not one of the Officers, acts as a key advisor and participant in strategy and oversight conversations.

## A1Q.04 — Sixth Hall Status and Duties

- **Prompt:**  
  > “Can we confirm the general role and mythos of the Sixth Hall?”

- **User Answer:**  
  > The Sixth Hall is unacknowledged in official records. It conducts off-book investigations into collapsed Threads, rogue Sorcery, and Entanglement events. It may operate across jurisdictions and is subject of widespread rumor.

- **Parsed Note:**  
  The Sixth Hall operates as the clandestine enforcement and observation wing of the Court, especially for unstable phenomena. Officially denied, it is an open secret among high-level Mages. It is suspected to engage with entities or phenomena that exceed standard ethical bounds.

- **Status:** ✓ integrated

## A1Q.05 — Session Structure and Document Strategy

- **Prompt:**  
  > “Does this framework make sense for managing canon vs. revision vs. rehydration?”

- **User Answer:**  
  > Yes. A# for summary, A#X for full silicon recall, A#Q for working errata. You load A#X + A#Q to begin refinement. Once A#Q is too large, we reconcile and revise A#X. You prompt for updates as needed during gameplay and revise documents accordingly.

- **Parsed Note:**  
  The A# / A#X / A#Q structure is finalized. Each serves a specific role: human reference, silicon rehydration, and refinement loop. Future topics will follow the same structure.

- **Status:** ✓ integrated
