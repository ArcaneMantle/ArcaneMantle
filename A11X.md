# [A11X] Magical Geography of the Mantle — Codex Edition

## Overview

Magic in the world is drawn from the **Aetheric Mantle**, a supra-material plane that coexists with the physical world, known as the **Materia**. These two planes—Aetheric and Material—interlace at points of magical expression, especially near Aetherwells, which are thought to represent breaches, overlaps, or collisions between the Mantle and the Materia.

Different schools of thought interpret this geography differently. Traditional Arcane scholarship teaches that the Mantle is segmented into distinct Strands and Threads, while Sorcery argues for a unified Aether and ascribes the perceived divisions to Entanglement following the Unraveling.

## 1. The Nature of the Mantle

- **The Aetheric Mantle**:
  - A supra-material magical plane from which all Aetheric energy is drawn.
  - Exists **coextensively** with the Materia—neither above nor below, but layered.
  - Its structure is interpreted through **Strands** (conceptual axes) and **Threads** (elemental or conceptual forces).

- **The Materia**:
  - The physical world experienced by all sentient beings.
  - Behaves according to known physical properties, but reacts to Aetheric input.

- **Thread & Strand Geography**:
  - Not literal geography—these are conceptual frameworks tied to resonance and magical influence.
  - Mages feel, rather than see, the alignment or friction between Threads.
  - Confluences can cause instability or deep magical harmonization.

---

## 2. Theories of Interaction

- **Traditional Arcane View**:
  - The Mantle is made of multiple, naturally distinct natures (Threads).
  - Aetherwells are localized expressions of these Threads breaking through or interacting with the Materia.

- **Sorcerous View (Revisionist)**:
  - The Mantle was once **unified** and seamless.
  - The fragmentation into Threads and Strands is a result of **Entanglement**, a consequence of the Unraveling.
  - Aetherwells are wounds—evidence of where the planes have been unnaturally fused or split.

## 3. Magical Terrain Features

- **Aetherwells**:
  - Anchor points where Aetheric energy becomes locally accessible.
  - Can dramatically alter environment (heat, cold, decay, bloom, etc.)
  - Believed to represent Mantle–Materia contact zones.
  - Examples: Emberwell, Frostwell, Forgewell, Steamwell, Stormwell, etc.

- **Collapsed Threads**:
  - Regions where resonance from a specific Thread has vanished or destabilized.
  - May cause magical dead zones or erratic behavior in that school of magic.

- **Magical Storm Zones**:
  - **Endless Blizzards (North)** and **Sandstorms (South)** are thought to be large-scale, self-reinforcing disruptions in Mantle–Materia interface.
  - These storms distort perception, magic, and even time in some accounts.

- **Skyfall**:
  - Waterfalls where the northern river descends from The Shelf.
  - Resonance intensifies nearby—believed to be shaped by the flow of both Aether and water.

- **The Deep Forge**:
  - A legendary subterranean structure in the Far West, said to be built atop the first Forgewell.
  - Serves as both a site of primal magic and mythical origin.

- **The Watcher and The Witness**:
  - Twin lighthouses located in Veil and its opposite coast.
  - Rumored to be magically linked—possibly through Mantle-based folding or teleportation.

## 4. Experiencing the Mantle

- **Mages do not “travel” to the Mantle** physically.
  - They enter resonance states—perceived overlays, visions, or metaphysical immersion.
  - Experiences may include:
    - Synaesthetic phenomena (light, sound, pressure)
    - Temporal or spatial distortion
    - Contact with semi-sentient echoes of Threads

- **Sorcerers** may experience more cohesive, boundaryless Aetheric states, especially when navigating Axes or in pre-Unraveling practices.

- Certain rituals, Wells, and resonance states can induce **deep harmonization**—a fragile moment where Mantle and Materia seem aligned.

---

## 5. Regional Compliance & Mythic Geography

- **The Mantle is universal**, but how it's accessed varies:
  - Some regions (e.g., The North) claim localized dominion over “ancestral Threads.”
  - Others (e.g., the Concord Zone) enforce highly regulated access to magical geography.

- **Black Zones**:
  - Places where resonance is toxic, forbidden, or lost.
  - May house collapsed Threads, failed Wells, or dangerous Sorcery sites.

- **Belief in the Threadless Land**:
  - A myth held by some Nomadic and Sorcerous sects.
  - A land beyond the weave—neither Threaded nor broken, but untouched.
