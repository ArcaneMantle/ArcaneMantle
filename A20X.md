# [A20X] Aetheric Materials and Components — Codex Edition

## Overview

Magic in the world of the Mantle is not purely theoretical—it leaves residues, catalyzes transformations, and can be bound to **materials** that amplify, store, or alter its effects. This codex outlines known **resonant substances**, their properties, and their institutional uses across the arcane world.

## 1. Resonance-Bound Materials

These materials either conduct, store, or modulate Aetheric energy.

### **1.1 Emberglass**
- Formed near intense Emberwell activity
- Translucent, reddish-orange crystalline glass
- Used in containment lenses and focus chambers
- High compatibility with **Fire**, **Forge**, and **Ash**

### **1.2 Nullstone**
- Opaque, matte-black stone
- Disrupts active resonance in proximity
- Used in:
  - Courtroom barriers
  - Null Chambers
  - Arcane prisons
- Dangerous in unstable Wells

### **1.3 Mantlethread**
- Silvery, elastic filament derived from crystallized resonance leakage
- Woven into **Proficiency Bands** or ritual vestments
- Threaded into glyphwork for stabilizing Axis convergence

### **1.4 Veilglass**
- Formed near Veil-heavy locations or collapsed threads
- Light-bending, semi-visible shards
- Allows scrying or momentary concealment
- Extremely fragile; often embedded in jewelry or monocles

## 2. Catalyst Components

Items required in ritual workings or augmentation.

### **2.1 Aetheric Salt**
- Powdered residue from discharged Aetheric cores
- Stabilizes resonance flows in chaotic conditions
- Used in ritual chalks, cleansing fields, and spell primers

### **2.2 Seer's Ink**
- Brewed using Echo-reactive fungi and diluted Mantlewater
- Enables long-duration enchantments and prophetic scripting
- Highly reactive to **Echo**, **Still**, and **Seer**

### **2.3 Verdant Pearl**
- Grown inside Rootwell-fed mollusks
- Stores limited Verdance; can catalyze healing rituals
- Often used in medical wards or botanical sanctums

## 3. Rare and Legendary Materials

### **3.1 Prism Iron**
- Absorbs and refracts magical energy like a prism
- Known to change Thread affinity based on incantation structure
- Highly unstable; only used in Axis research or elite dueling gear

### **3.2 Unfolded Mantlecloth**
- Said to originate from **collapsed strands** or moments of resonance collapse
- Allows brief interaction with entangled states or Echo-bound loci
- Usually destroyed upon use

---

## 4. Institutional Usage

- **Arcane Court**: Uses Nullstone, Mantlethread, and containment salts in trials
- **Conclave Academies**: Employ Emberglass and Verdant Pearls in instruction
- **Codex Lodges**: Utilize Veilglass, Prism Iron, and Unfolded Mantlecloth in Axis research
