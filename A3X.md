# [A3X] The Codex of the Mantle & Sorcery — Codex Edition

## Summary
This file contains the full canonized record of Sorcery and its governing body, the **Codex of the Mantle**. Sorcery is a discipline based on the belief that the apparent structure of the Aetheric Mantle (Threads, Strands, Weaves) is an artificial consequence of the Unraveling. Sorcerers seek to harness magic through resonance across multiple Threads, typically aligned along conceptual **Axes**, in pursuit of a return to the **Prime Mantle**.

---

## 1. Philosophical Foundation

### Traditionalist View
- The prevailing doctrine across most of the arcane world.
- Holds that Threads, Strands, and Weaves are natural structures of the Mantle.
- Traditional Mages specialize in singular Threads or tightly related pairs within a Strand.
- The Arcane Court and most Grand Academies uphold this doctrine.

### Revisionist View (Sorcery)
- Asserts that the Mantle was once a continuous, undifferentiated magical force (the **Prime Mantle**).
- Threads and Strands are seen as artifacts of damage or segmentation caused by the Unraveling.
- Sorcerers study **effects** first (e.g., decay, displacement, transmutation), and back-trace the Aetheric Axes involved.
- Many believe the **Order Thread** was not destroyed, but deliberately suppressed or exiled.

## 2. The Codex of the Mantle

- An independent organization of Sorcerers, unaffiliated with the Arcane Court or Conclave.
- Functions more as a philosophical and archival body than a governing force.
- Structured around **Enclaves**, each representing a grouping of related Axes of Resonance.
- Maintains a network of **Lodges** across the continent—some sanctioned, others secret.
- Not formally recognized by most national governments, but tolerated due to their small size and low threat profile.

---

## 3. Axes of Resonance

- An **Axis** is a structured alignment of resonance across multiple Threads.
- Sorcerers use Axes to bridge Threads that would otherwise be unstable or impossible to combine.
- Axes are categorized by **rarity**, **theme**, and **permissibility**.

### Known Classifications
- **Unrestricted**: Openly studied (e.g., Duality of Illumination)
- **Monitored**: Requires registration
- **Restricted**: Requires Compact approval
- **Highly Restricted**: Requires institutional affiliation (Codex, Court, or Chorus)
- **Forbidden**: Prohibited entirely

---

## 4. The Joint Arcane Compact on Sorcery

- A tripartite oversight body composed of:
  - 7 members from the **Board of Governors**
  - 7 from the **Arcane Court / Conclave**
  - 7 from the **Codex of the Mantle**
- Responsible for classifying Axes and defining the limits of legal Sorcery.
- Led by three rotating **Lead Delegates**, one from each body.
- Delegates serve **7-year terms** and may not serve consecutive terms.

---

## 5. Sorcerer Titles and Ranks

- **Archon** – Master of a single Axis
- **Diarch** – Master of two Axes (usually within one Enclave)
- **Triarch** – Three Axes
- **Tetrarch** – Four Axes
- **Quintarch** – Five or more Axes, often spanning Enclaves
- Titles are philosophical markers, not legal ranks

---

## 6. Enclaves

- Enclaves are **non-physical classifications** used to group Axes by conceptual themes.
- Each Enclave contains 2–6 Axes of Resonance.
- Example: The **Enclave of Technological Emergence** includes the three Ripple Axes (Forge + Steam + Storm).

---

## 7. Lodges

- Physical meeting places for Sorcerers
- Can be attached to an Academy, housed within a city, or completely hidden
- Each Lodge is managed by a **Lodge Steward**
- Some serve as training centers, others as archival libraries or philosophical retreats

---

## 8. Legal Status of Sorcery

- Practicing Sorcery is not inherently illegal under the Arcane Covenant
- Violation of classified or restricted Axes may result in court action
- The Arcane Court maintains a policy of **suspicion but tolerance**
- The Sixth Hall is rumored to monitor high-risk Lodges and rogue Sorcerers

---

## 9. Legendary Sorcerers

- **Valporeon the Red** – Tetrarch; founder of the Conservatories of Arcane Conflict; believed to have wielded all aspects of the Mantle
- **The Pale Mirror** – Anonymous; speculated to have mastered an Axis of Time
- **Saelven of the Crossed Mantle** – Documented as having attempted reconnection with the Order Thread
