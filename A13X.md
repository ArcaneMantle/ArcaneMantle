# [A13X] Magical Institutions and Organizations — Codex Edition

## Overview

The world’s arcane landscape is shaped not only by governments and grand academies, but also by a broad constellation of magical institutions. These include Guilds, Orders, Colleges, and Sorcerous bodies—each with its own internal governance, traditions, and degree of recognition under the Arcane Covenant.

This file provides a working codex of these institutions. **All entries are provisional and marked for mandatory revision**, as this topic is actively under review and subject to clarification once the scraping process completes.
