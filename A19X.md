# [A19X] Mythic Sorcery and Legendary Axes — Codex Edition

## Overview

Mythic Sorcery represents the highest and rarest echelon of magical resonance—paths so profound, unstable, or powerful that they challenge the structure of the Mantle itself. Practitioners of these Axes are legends, feared or venerated in equal measure.

This codex tracks the known **Mythic Axes**, their **associated Sorcerers**, and the legendary titles borne by those who master more than one Axis.

## 3. Implications of Mythic Axes

- Many incorporate Threads thought to be **collapsed** (e.g. Order) or **dangerously unstable**
- Some require:
  - **Veil-based navigation**
  - **Non-sanctioned Axis harmonization**
  - **Interaction with primal or uncharted Wells**
- Their use often results in political consequences, institutional expulsion, or forced isolation

## 4. Sorcerous Titles

Titles granted to Sorcerers who master multiple Axes:

| Title | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Archon** | Mastery of one Axis |
| **Diarch** | Two Axes (especially within one Weave) |
| **Triarch** | Three Axes (usually spanning two Weaves) |
| **Tetrarch** | Four Axes, generally crossing all Weaves |
| **Quintarch** | Five or more Axes (often disputed or legendary) |

> Some Sorcerers reject titles, preferring anonymity or spiritual neutrality.

## 5. Myth and Mystery

- Many mythic Axes are known **only through fragments** in Concord records, Sorcerous dreamwork, or collapsed Mantle phenomena
- Some are rumored to require **Axis synthesis**—where a new Axis emerges from the resonance of two others
