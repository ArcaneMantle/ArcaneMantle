## Summary
This Codex Edition contains the currently retained structural, political, and territorial framework of the Empire—a dominant centralized monarchy located in the heart of the continent. While stable and well-defined in its core, this file is marked **High Priority for Revision** due to potential expansions in dynastic history, cultural identity, legal nuance, and geopolitical policy.
