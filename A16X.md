# [A16X] The Unraveling — Codex Edition

## Overview

The Unraveling is the single most significant metaphysical event in recorded magical history. It marked the **rupture of the Aetheric Mantle**, the **loss of the Order Thread**, and the dawn of modern magical civilization. Every contemporary arcane institution—from the Arcane Court to the Codex of the Mantle—traces its existence or purpose to the aftermath of this cataclysm.

---

## 1. Nature of the Event

- The Unraveling was **not a war**, **not a spell**, and **not a singular ritual**.
- It was a **structural collapse** in the continuity of the Aetheric Mantle.
- Resulted in:
  - The **fragmentation** of unified Aether into discrete Threads
  - The **loss or severance** of the Thread of Order
  - The emergence of **Confluent Threads**
  - The spread of **Entanglement**

It is debated whether the event was natural, inflicted, or preventable.

---

## 2. Consequences

- **Collapse of the Unified Mantle** into segmented Weaves
- **Loss of direct communion** with formerly coherent Aetheric forces
- **Rise of Thread instability** and emergence of Discord
- **Birth of Aetherwells**, viewed by some as Entanglement scars
- **Suppression of primal magical traditions**
- **Creation of Pax Arcana** and the Arcane Covenant

---

## 3. The Lost Thread: Order

- The **Thread of Order** was a central Liminal force
- Post-Unraveling, it is considered **collapsed**
- Cannot be directly accessed, although it features in:
  - Historical rituals
  - Axis-based magical theory
  - Some interpretations of Sorcery
- Its loss destabilized both Filum Principium and broader Liminal resonance

---

## 4. Interpretations and Beliefs

### Traditionalist
- The Unraveling was the natural end of a metaphysical cycle.
- The Mantle restructured to protect the world from magical overload.

### Sorcerous (Revisionist)
- The Unraveling was **inflicted**—possibly by early Mage factions.
- The Mantle was once unified and **unnaturally segmented** by Entanglement.
- The Lost Thread (Order) may still exist, detached but not destroyed.

---

## 5. Institutional Legacy

- **Arcane Court**: Founded to regulate magic and prevent future destabilization
- **Arcane Conclave**: Convened to draft the Arcane Covenant and uphold the Pax Arcana
- **Codex of the Mantle**: Emerged to resist Traditionalist codification and recover unified resonance
- **Sorcery**: Rejected Thread segmentation, promotes Axis theory and harmonization

---

## 6. Rumors and Apocrypha

- Some believe **Valporeon the Red** may have witnessed or caused part of the Unraveling
- There are whispers of ancient Orders who attempted to **restore Order** and were wiped from history
- Aetheric anomalies near collapsed Threads are sometimes blamed on “Mantle echoes”
