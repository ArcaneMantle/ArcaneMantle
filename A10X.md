# [A10X] The Isles — Codex Edition

## Overview

The Isles encompass a scattering of coastal and frozen island chains off the eastern and northeastern shores of the continent. While some host trade outposts or minor fishing settlements, others are dominated by arcane mystery, raider enclaves, and ancient magic. The region is home to both the enigmatic city of Veil and the island-anchored Seventh Kingdom of the North.
