# [A6X] The North — Codex Edition

## Summary
The North is composed of seven independently governed kingdoms, culturally and geographically divided by a massive elevated landform known as **The Shelf**. While loosely united under the option to elect a High King, the northern kingdoms are politically fragmented, culturally diverse, and defined by terrain-driven distinctions. This file includes their structure, relationships, regional traditions, and the defining role of The Shelf.

---

## 1. Political Structure

- **7 Kingdoms Total**
  - **2 Southern Tundra Kingdoms** (below The Shelf): Kingdoms 1 and 2
  - **4 Northern Kingdoms** (above The Shelf): Kingdoms 3, 4, 5, and 7
  - **1 Eastern Raider Kingdom** (coastal + Frozen Isles): Kingdom 6
- A **High King** may be elected when **5 or more kingdoms** agree
- Only the **Tundra Kingdoms** are signatories to the **Arcane Covenant**

---

## 2. Geographic Division: The Shelf

- A vast, steep mountain ridge separating the tundra lowlands from the high northern interior
- Known as **The Shelf**, it defines both cultural and magical boundaries
- Traversed by a handful of fortified **passes**, whose control is:
  - Militarized
  - Contested
  - Politically volatile
- The **Great Northern River** flows **through The Shelf**, cascading at a site known as **Skyfall**

---

## 3. Kingdom Placement (Reference: Stylized Map)

- **Kingdom 1 & 2 (Red):** Tundra kingdoms, south of The Shelf
  - Border The Shelf directly
- **Kingdom 3, 4, 5 (Green):** Northern kingdoms above The Shelf
  - Border The Shelf to the south
- **Kingdom 6 (Purple):** Eastern raider kingdom; includes coastal and isle territories
- **Kingdom 7 (Yellow):** Northernmost, does **not** border The Shelf; extremely rugged and traditional

## 4. Cultural & Political Differences

### Tundra Kingdoms (1 & 2)
- Signatories to the Arcane Covenant
- Mild influence from Concord and Empire
- More likely to trade or negotiate
- Border zones feature heavy patrols and checkpoints

### Northern Kingdoms (3, 4, 5, 7)
- Not aligned with the Arcane Covenant
- Maintain ancestral Weave traditions, independent of AC law
- **Kingdom 7** especially rugged, culturally distinct, and defined by winter survival

### Eastern Raider Kingdom (6)
- Part of the seven-kingdom High King system, but culturally distinct
- Shares population and control over coastal raiding camps and Frozen Isle outposts
- Close alliance with Veil and some of the Sixth Trade Republic’s maritime entities

---

## 5. Strategic Passes

- Known and named passes are monitored by both northern and southern kingdoms
- **Treaty of Skyfall** guarantees merchant and civilian transit rights
- Frequent diplomatic friction and **border skirmishes** occur over interpretation and control
- Smuggling and unregistered passage through **uncontrolled passes** is extremely dangerous

---

## 6. Arcane & Mythic Elements

- Northern traditions may include:
  - **Primal Mantle communion** unrecognized by the AC
  - **Ritual dueling platforms**, **frost-bound shrines**, and **ancestral Threadcraft**
  - Isolated cases of magic seemingly unaffiliated with any known Thread
- These cultures are deeply suspicious of Concord-led magical policy
