# [A8X] The West — Codex Edition

## Overview

The West is a region of fractured monarchies, independent arcane cities, and ancient mountain cultures. It is divided politically and ideologically between the kingdoms of the **Western Foothills**, which uphold the Arcane Covenant, and the isolated **Far Western Kingdom**, which remains neutral toward magical law. The region is defined by a legacy of civil war, the presence of two Grand Academies, and a tension between old-world feudalism and modern arcane governance.

## 1. Western Foothills (Arcane Covenant-Aligned)

### Kingdom of Caerthwyn
- Easternmost and closest to the Empire.
- Assertive in regional politics; claims contested lands from the Kelvren conflict.
- Observes the Arcane Covenant and allows Arcane Court activity.

### Kingdom of Dravennar
- Central kingdom with strong military heritage.
- Former ally of Caerthwyn during the war against Kelvren.
- Now increasingly independent; friction growing with all neighboring states.

### Kingdom of Kelvren
- Diminished and divided:
  - **A. Sovereign Remnant** — Kelvren-controlled land.
  - **B. Jointly Administered Zone** — demilitarized buffer held by Vale and Imperial forces.
  - **C. Disputed Territory** — claimed by Caerthwyn or Dravennar; viewed by Kelvren as unlawfully annexed.
- Kelvren maintains formal status but its sovereignty is fractured.

### The Vale
- Southernmost kingdom; culturally distinct.
- Known for diplomacy, neutral arbitration, and arcane infrastructure.
- Home to the **Grand Academy at Valereach**.
- Intervened in the Caerthwyn–Dravennar war; negotiated ceasefire 5 miles from Kelvren’s capital.
- Co-administers the Joint Zone with **Imperial peacekeeping support**.

## 2. The Far West (Arcane Covenant-Neutral)

### [Placeholder] The Westernmost Kingdom
- Rugged, mountainous kingdom with deep traditions.
- Does **not observe the Arcane Covenant**, but is not hostile to it.
- Permits free movement of Mages; governs arcane activity internally.
- Maintains respectful relations with Viremont.

## 3. Independent Arcane Territories

### Viremont
- An isolated mountaintop city with no formal allegiance.
- Borders only the impassable mountain range to the west and the Far Western Kingdom to the east.
- Host of **Highreach**, one of the Seven Grand Academies.
- Home to the **Chorus of Archmages**, a rare assembly of elite Mages.
- Respected by all nearby realms but politically independent.

### Valereach
- Capital of The Vale.
- Grand Academy of Valereach is renowned for neutral pedagogy and arcane ethics.
- Serves as a cultural and political bridge between feudal West and arcane East.

---

## 4. Arcane Covenant Compliance

- **Caerthwyn, Dravennar, Kelvren, and The Vale** are all Covenant-aligned.
- The **Westernmost Kingdom** is neutral but not obstructive.
- **Viremont** is apolitical, but holds a highly respected arcane tradition.
