# [A18X] The Joint Compact on Sorcery — Codex Edition

## Overview

The **Joint Compact on Sorcery**, commonly referred to as **The Compact**, is the governing body responsible for the oversight, classification, and regulation of Sorcery across all signatory arcane institutions. It exists to balance institutional stability with the evolving nature of resonance theory—particularly the controversial study of Aetheric Axes.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The Compact serves to:

- **Classify Aetheric Axes** as Unrestricted, Monitored, Restricted, Highly Restricted, or Forbidden
- Define permissible study, usage, and dissemination of Sorcery
- Mediate disputes between Traditionalists and Revisionists
- Protect arcane society from unregulated entanglement experimentation

---

## 2. Structure and Membership

### Composition:
- **21 Members Total**, divided equally into:
  - **7** from the **Board of Governors** (Grand Academies)
  - **7** from the **Arcane Court / Conclave**
  - **7** from the **Codex of the Mantle**

### Delegation Traits:
- **BoG Delegates**:
  - Appointed by the Board of Regents
  - ~80% are practicing Sorcerers
  - Emphasize academic freedom and innovation

- **Court/Conclave Delegates**:
  - Appointed by the Arcane Court’s Select Council
  - ~50% are Sorcerers or sympathizers
  - Prioritize balance, legality, and institutional continuity

- **Codex Delegates**:
  - Always Sorcerers
  - Chosen by undisclosed Codex protocols
  - Promote restoration of unified magic and Axial study

## 3. Leadership and Decision-Making


### Delegation and Term Rotation (Updated)

Each constituent organization (BoG, Court/Conclave, Codex) maintains a **seven-member delegation**.

- **Term Length**: Each delegate serves a **7-year term**.
- **Rotation**: Every year, the **longest-serving delegate** from each group retires, and a **new delegate is appointed**.
- **Lead Delegates**: In their **seventh and final year**, one delegate from each delegation serves as its **Lead Delegate** for that year.

This creates a continual rotation, ensuring:
- Staggered institutional memory
- Equal leadership opportunity across all members
- A perpetual balance of continuity and renewal


## 4. Axis Classification System

| Tier | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Unrestricted** | Open to all Mages | May be studied and practiced freely |
| **Monitored** | Open, but tracked | Must be registered with local institution |
| **Restricted** | Requires approval | Must receive Compact or academy clearance |
| **Highly Restricted** | Advanced access only | Requires institutional sponsorship (e.g., Chorus, Court) |
| **Forbidden** | Banned | May not be taught or practiced under any circumstance |

Axes may be reclassified over time based on research, precedent, or danger.

## 5. Enforcement and Oversight

- Compact rulings are **binding on all chartered academies and courts**
- Enforcement may be carried out by:
  - Local academy governance
  - Codex enforcement arms
  - Arcane Court Justiciars
- Forbidden studies discovered in practice may lead to trial or erasure

---

## 6. Historical Significance

- The Compact was formed following early Sorcery-related incidents that threatened:
  - Mantle stability
  - Inter-Strand harmony
  - Aetheric well proximity
- Its founding helped prevent civil schism between Traditionalist and Sorcerous factions
