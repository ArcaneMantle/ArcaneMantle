# [A7X] The East — Codex Edition

## Overview

The East is defined by its sophisticated trade networks, political autonomy, and arcane diplomacy. Governed not by monarchies or empires, but by federated trade republics, the region thrives on commerce, river access, and arcane regulation. The Concordian Cities anchor the region politically, while five major republics and one minor northern republic maintain significant regional power.
