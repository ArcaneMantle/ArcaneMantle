# [ScrapeStatus_Log3] — Canon Recovery Snapshot

This document captures the state of the lore extraction from **GameWorld3_Extracted.md** as of this pass. It identifies what content was integrated, what was held aside to avoid memory conflict, and what should be formalized once the A#X dump completes.

---

## ✅ Integrated Content (Safe, Contextually Stable)

- **Concordian Senate Structure**
  - Expanded seat allocations by external republics
  - Internal civic representation structure confirmed
  - Currency dominance model with Concord Mint vs. IGP clarified

- **Arcane Court Lore**
  - Additional Sixth Hall rumors confirmed
  - Minor clarifications to Warden Marshal logistics
  - None of this displaced current BoG or Proficiency mechanics

- **Northern Geography**
  - Skyfall and The Shelf geographical context preserved
  - Confirmed naming conventions of the seven kingdoms
  - Reaffirmed Eastern Raider Kingdom’s partial Frozen Isles alignment

- **NPC and Faction Additions**
  - Recovered named subfactions including Arcane Orders (historical placeholder)
  - Preliminary sketch of Imperial Aetherguard (not yet placed)

---

## ⚠️ Held for Later (Pending Integration After A#X Codex Completion)

These entries were identified in Log 3 but **not integrated** due to current revision focus or risk of pruning key data:

- **Resonance Tier Logic**
  - Conflicts or duplications in Tier II/III generation procedures
  - Early interpretations of Discord Penalties inconsistent with current model

- **Academy and Institute Structure**
  - Preliminary rules for minor Institutes
  - Deprecated naming of Institutes/Societies within Academies
  - Alternate BoG certification and Registrar functions

- **Celestial Licensing**
  - Conflicting references to Arcane Court oversight of Celestial Threads
  - Log suggests dual-licensing system prior to BoG consolidation

---

## ✅ Action Notes

- Continue scrape from **Log 2** using same filtering protocol
- Once `A#X` dumps are complete, begin reconsolidation of held entries
- First merge target: `A5U` — Concord Codex update with full Senate structure
- Second target: `A4U` or new file for Imperial Aetherguard
